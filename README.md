This code was created as a component of the "Programming from Scratch" course provided by [DIO](https://www.dio.me/).

## What should be used

- Variables
- Operators
- Decision structures
- Functions
- Classes and Objects

### Objective

Create a generic class representing a hero in an adventure, with the following properties:

- Name
- Age
- Type (e.g., warrior, mage, monk, ninja)

Additionally, it should have a method called **"attack"** that must meet the following requirements:

- Display the message: "The **{type}** attacked using **{attack}**"
- Where **{type}** should be concatenated with the type from the class property
- And **{attack}** should have a different description based on the type, following the table below:

 If | Display
 ----- | :-----: 
mage | magic 
warrior | sword
monk |  martial arts
ninja | used shuriken

#### Output
In the end, a message should be displayed:

"The **{type}** attacked using **{attack}**"

e.g., mage attacked using magic

warrior attacked using sword
